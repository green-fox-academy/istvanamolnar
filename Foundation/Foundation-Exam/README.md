## Exercises

### Multiply items in a matrix

Write a method that takes a matrix as a parameter.

The function should:

- multiply each even number by 2 in each even indexed row
- multiply each odd number by 2 in each odd indexed row

Write at least 2 different test cases.

#### Example

Input

```
[
  [1, 3, 6, 2],
  [7, 5, 6, 1],
  [3, 3, 1, 5],
  [9, 0, 5, 3]
]
```

Output

```
[
  [1,  3,  12, 4],
  [14, 10, 6,  2],
  [3,  3,  1,  5],
  [18, 0,  10, 6]
]
```

### Most rainy days

Write a method which can read and parse a file containing information about
weather in various cities. The method must return the name of the city which
had the most rainy days.

#### Example

[Example file can be found here.](./cities.csv)

Output

```
Gyor
```
### Restaurant

Your task is to create a program to model the every day life in a restaurant.

#### Restaurant

- Every restaurant has a `name`, the year it was `founded` and a list of `employees` who are working there.
- It should have a method `guests arrived` which should instruct all employees to `work`
- We should be able to `hire` an employee which will add it to the list of `employees`

#### Employee

- Every employee has a `name`, an `experience` (number) and a method `work`
- The `experience` should start from `0` by default if it is not provided
- Every employee should be able to `work`, however the specific behavior is different for every kind

**We cannot hire or create basic employee** because they should always be some kind of specific employee like `Chef`, `Manager` or `Waiter`.

##### Waiter 

- It should store the amount of `tips` it has - in the beginning this is `0`
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase the amount of `tips` by `1`
  - It should increase its `experience` by `1`

##### Chef

- It should store information about the `meals` it ever cooked (name of the food + amount of times it was cooked)
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase its `experience` by `1`
- It should have a `cook` behavior
  - This should get the `name of the food` as an input
  - This should update the `meals` information so we are able to track that it cooked this specific food again

##### Manager

- It should have a `moodLevel` - in the beginning this is `400`
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase the `experience` by `1`
  - It should invoke its `have a meeting` behaviour
- Whenever `have a meeting` is invoked, the `moodLevel` should decrease by the managers `experience`

## Questions

### What is a unit test? What are different test cases?
A unit test is testing the smallest part of a program.
Other types of test: Integration test, System test, Acceptance test.

### What is the difference between runtime and compile time error? Write 1-1 example.
Runtime error (e.g. Logic Error) only occurs when the code is running (after compilation), while a compiler error happens, when trying to compile the code (e.g. Syntax Error).

Runtime error: 
let a = '';
console.log(b);

Compile error:
let a = '';
console.log'a';
